## Presentation

### Overview

The entire world was rocked by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there was little to no control over the origins of the virus, it might be possible to determine factors that help contain and control its spread. This project seeks to investigate whether underlying economic factors can predict COVID statistics.

### Motivation/Rationale

I am interested in public health for a number of reasons, mainly because it affects the entire population. I chose to investigate the COVID-19 pandemic as it has been at the forefront of every individual's life for the better part of three years, and continues to impact everyday existence. In order to prevent more devistating impacts from the virus, I decided to collect economic data as well as COVID statistics to try to find relationships between them.
